# Dense Motion Estimation Using Block-Based Video Coding

## Project Overview
Developed a hybrid video coding framework implementing block-based motion estimation to approximate dense motion fields across frames.

## Key Methods
- Exhaustive Block Matching Algorithm (EBMA)
- Motion vector visualization
- Residual frame generation
- Compression evaluation (PSNR, SSIM)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Results
- Achieved motion-compensated frame prediction
- Visualized block motion fields and compression gains

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies (`pip install opencv-python numpy`)
2. Run `motion_estimation.py`
3. Input video samples are in `/videos`
